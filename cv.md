## About me

I graduated from medical university. It wasn’t easy to get there and was hard enough to study, so I got used to studying and I like to do it even now. I also completed an internship after university. There I have learned how to communicate with people (patients are very different and an approach is needed for each). Also, I am quite stress-resistant, as in medicine there is no other way. Over time, I realized that medicine is not my calling. And programming is another matter. I like to make websites and solve tasks on codewars (I can't do high levels yet, but I will learn over time). I already have several small projects of my own and am constantly working on myself.

   let arr = [];
     for(let i = 0; i < y.length; i++) {
       if(arr.includes(y[i]) !== true) {
       arr.push(y[i])
    }
  };

    let x = arr.join('');

    if(str.length === x.length || x == "") {
        return true;
    } else  {
        return false;
  }
};
